Team: ${team.teamName}
Home Venue: ${homeGround.ground}
Pitch Type: ${homeGround.pitchType}
Spin Friendly: ${homeGround.spinFriendly ? 'YES — spinners dominate here' : 'NO — pace/batting dominates here'}
Key Insight: ${homeGround.notes}

This is CRITICAL for evaluation. Judge whether this team bought the RIGHT type of bowlers, 
batters and all-rounders to dominate at their home ground.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
IPL IMPACT PLAYER RULE (2024 onwards)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
An Impact Player can replace any player before the start of any over (batting or bowling).
This means the BEST impact sub is effectively a 12th playing member who WILL contribute
meaningfully. Evaluate the team's EFFECTIVE STRENGTH as Playing 11 + the #1 Impact Sub below.

USER'S SELECTED STARTING XI (11 players):
${userXI.map(id => {
        const p = team.playersAcquired.find(pa => String(pa.id || pa._id) === id);
        if (!p) return `Unknown Player (ID:${id})`;
        const s = p.stats || {};
        return `${p.name} (${p.role}) | SR ${s.strikeRate || 'N/A'} Avg ${s.average || 'N/A'} Wkts ${s.wickets || 'N/A'} Econ ${s.economy || 'N/A'}`;
    }).join('\n')}

#1 IMPACT SUB — ACTS AS 12TH PLAYER (evaluate as part of effective XI):
${bestImpact ? (() => {
        const s = bestImpact.stats || {};
        return `${bestImpact.name} (${bestImpact.role}) | SR ${s.strikeRate || 'N/A'} Avg ${s.average || 'N/A'} Wkts ${s.wickets || 'N/A'} Econ ${s.economy || 'N/A'}`;
    })() : 'No impact player selected'}

REMAINING IMPACT SUBS (rotation/speciality contingency — not primary):
${remainingBenchImpact.length > 0 ? remainingBenchImpact.map(p => {
        const s = p.stats || {};
        return `${p.name} (${p.role}) | SR ${s.strikeRate || 'N/A'} Econ ${s.economy || 'N/A'}`;
    }).join('\n') : 'None'}

BENCH (not selected):
${bench.map(p => `${p.name} (${p.role}) | SR ${p.stats?.strikeRate || 'N/A'} Econ ${p.stats?.economy || 'N/A'}`).join('\n')}

AI COACH'S RECOMMENDED HOME XI:
${homePlaying11.map(id => team.playersAcquired.find(pa => String(pa.id || pa._id) === id)?.name || id).join(', ')}

AI COACH'S RECOMMENDED AWAY XI:
${awayPlaying11.map(id => team.playersAcquired.find(pa => String(pa.id || pa._id) === id)?.name || id).join(', ')}

═══════════════════════════════════════════════
EVALUATION CRITERIA (judge ALL of these strictly)
═══════════════════════════════════════════════
1. EFFECTIVE XI+1 BALANCE: Does the combination of XI + #1 Impact Sub (12 players) cover all roles?
   - At least 1 specialist Wicketkeeper (MS Dhoni, Sanju Samson, Rishabh Pant are keepers).
   - Minimum 5 bowling options in the combined 12.
   - Mix of Anchors + Aggressors in batting order.

2. HOME GROUND SUITABILITY (critical metric):
   - If home is SPIN-FRIENDLY: Do they have 2+ quality spinners? Are their key batters good against spin?
   - If home is PACE-FRIENDLY: Do they have 2+ quality fast bowlers? Can their batters handle pace/bounce?
   - If home is BATTING PARADISE: Do they have power hitters in top 6? Are their bowlers good at defending?
   - PENALISE heavily if their bowling attack doesn't suit their home ground type.
   - REWARD if they obviously built the squad around their home conditions.

3. IMPACT PLAYER STRATEGY: Does the chosen #1 Impact Sub genuinely improve the team?
   - e.g., bringing in a specialist bowler if the XI is bowling-light, or a power hitter for death overs.

4. AUCTION INTELLIGENCE: Did they over-invest in similar profiles? Gap in critical roles?

5. For evaluation, treat every player as their IPL PRIME version.
   - CRITICAL ROLE RECOGNITION: Players like Sunil Narine, Ravindra Jadeja, and Axar Patel MUST be recognized as ELITE SPINNERS even if their role is 'All-Rounder'. 
   - Do NOT call a squad "lacking in spin" if they have elite all-rounder spinners like Narine or Jadeja.
